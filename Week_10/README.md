This week's homework assignmwnt was to use Javascript on our existing midterm website. I was unsure how to incorporate the material that we had gone over into my "Pointless Games" website, only because geolocation seemed too complex for a '97 themed website and I already used the alert function. Instead, I made a new HTML page with a button that randomizes items in an array that I created. The array contains the phrase "hello" in different langauges, and the button randomizes them every time you click with the math.random() function.
