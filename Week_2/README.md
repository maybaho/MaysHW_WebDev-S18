This week, I created a site map for allrecipes.com - the website I got the carrot cake recipe from. The basic diagrom of the information architecture included subpages under the main "home" page, sub pages under those, and last, links to different recipes under each of those. The website categorizes the recipes by ingredient, occaison, type, course, etc. All the website are under the "browse" page, and there are also links to "about", "contact", "index" and "search". 

I used this website to get ideas for my own recipe website layout design. I wireframed one recipe page for my hypothetical website. The page includes a header for the title, an image section, a side bar, and a space for ingredients list and method. On the wireframe, I marked up the block content with some HTML content for reference.
