For my midterm website, I wanted to create a site for pointless games. The idea is that the games don't have real objectives, are not "winn-able", and are useful only for procrastination (hopefully, they will also be somewhat amusing). I want to take simple games that we already know, like tetris, snake, pong, etc. and remove the actual "game" part - so that they are recognizeable, but not play-able. I want to create the games myself, recognizing that this puts many limitations due to my lack of knowledge in game development. 

The webiste is modeled after the Windows 98 aesthetic, using a basic color scheme and simple animations. Originally, I wanted a more eccentric website, with animations, interactivity, other weird pixelated characters, etc., but I found that it required a lot of javascript and included too many things beyond my skillset that would have required much more time. The most difficult part of the code was definitely getting the games to work on HTML. I had initially created them on Processing and had to tweak it for P5 so that it was compatibale with HTML. Even with the minor adjustments, however, a lot of the code didn't work or the game didn't render at all. For Games 2 & 3, I just rewrote a simpler version of the code (that servd the general idea of those games) in javascript directly into the document. For the other two, I was able to use an external file. One thing I still don't understand, after many failed attempts, is how to stylize the javascript files using CSS. Despite my efforts, I was unable to move the Snake and Pong game windows to the center of the page, even with a div, or add backgrounds, etc. 


Things to be learn and/or improve upon: 

1) Learn how to import fonts on the Processing games (to match the pixelated look)

2) Learn how to style script with CSS

3) Have each game look like it's open in its own seperate window, still visibile behind the other, so when you switch pages, it looks like you're just bringing that window to the front

4) More interactivity/animation with the icons in the background

5) More games!
